        <p>Welcome to my Course Home Page! I'm Rodolfo Menoacal, a 23-year-old resident of the vibrant city of Managua, Nicaragua. My journey into the world of technology has been driven by an insatiable curiosity and a passion for exploring the possibilities it offers. Over past few months, I have taken it upon myself to dive into the world of web programming, starting with basic courses, all with a thirst for knowledge and a drive to master this ever-evolving field.</p>
